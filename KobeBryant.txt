Kobe Bryant was one of the most iconic and relentless competitors in basketball history. 
Drafted straight out of high school in 1996 by the Charlotte Hornets and traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, 
Bryant spent his entire 20-year career with the franchise. 
Known for his "Mamba Mentality," Kobe's dedication to the game and work ethic became legendary. 
He won five NBA championships and two Finals MVPs, leaving an indelible mark on the sport with his footwork,
scoring ability, and clutch performances. 
Off the court, Bryant was a philanthropist, entrepreneur, and Oscar-winning filmmaker. 
His tragic death in 2020 only solidified his legacy as one of the game's all-time greats.
