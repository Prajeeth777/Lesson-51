Stephen Curry revolutionized basketball with his unparalleled shooting ability and innovative playing style. 
Born in 1988, Curry was often overlooked due to his small frame but defied expectations at Davidson College, leading them to the Elite Eight in the 2008 NCAA Tournament. 
Drafted by the Golden State Warriors in 2009, Curry overcame early injury struggles to become the greatest shooter in NBA history. 
His deep three-pointers, quick release, and off-ball movement reshaped how the game is played, making the three-point shot a central weapon in modern basketball. 
Winning four NBA championships and two MVP awards, Curry's legacy is built on both individual brilliance and team success.
